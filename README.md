# TechDegree Unit 10 Project - Build a Library Manager

## Purpose:
* Practice creating and managing a SQL database on the backend.
* Learn to interface the database with the user through a web-based book managment system.
* Practice SQLite, Sequelize, Express, and Pug skills. 
## Note:
* Initial CSS, HTML mockups, and populated database was provided by Treehouse.
* I built the backend (Express app), created the Pug views, and updated the CSS to reflect personal style. 
## To Use:
Download the project, then in your terminal, navigate to the directory and use `npm install` to download all dependencies.
**Note**You will need to install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

Once installed, run `npm start` in your terminal to start a development server. Using your browser of choice, go to `localhost:3000`.

Enjoy!
